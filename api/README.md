# Twitch Stream Clone - API

The Mock API for a streaming application that mimics Twitch.

## JSON-Server

This mock API uses [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## db.json

- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to db.json using lowdb.
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example {"name": "Foobar"})
- Id values are not mutable. Any id value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will be respected, but only if not already taken.
- A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a Content-Type: application/json header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.

## db.json struture

```json
{
  "streams": [
    {
      "title": "lorem",
      "description": "lorem",
      "userId": "219380238902183921083021",
      "id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```
